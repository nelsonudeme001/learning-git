#My Journey to Learning Git and GitHub
-----
This is simply a personal learning path for myself to learn version control using git

So far I have learned `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git status`, `git log`, and `git rm --cached <file>`

In the next couple of days I will be learning how to pull from GitHub into my local machine.
